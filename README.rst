This documentation is my (incomplete) solutions to `EoPL3`__ exercises.

The Scheme code is written using the ``eopl`` dialect provided by DrRacket 6.4. Please refer to `the official DrRacket documentation`__ for more details. 

To run the code, first install Racket 6.4+, then install the ``eopl`` package::

    $ raco pkg install eopl
