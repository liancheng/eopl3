Overview
########

This documentation is my (incomplete) solutions to `EoPL3`__ exercises. The source code can be found on `GitHub`__.

The Scheme code is written using the ``eopl`` dialect provided by DrRacket 6.4. Please refer to `the official DrRacket documentation`__ for more details. Most code snippets are tested using ``rackunit``.

To run the code, first install Racket 6.4+, then install the ``eopl`` package::

    $ raco pkg install eopl
