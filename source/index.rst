Overview
########

This documentation is my (incomplete) solutions to `Essentials of Programming Languages 3rd edition`__ exercises. The source code can be found on `GitHub`__.

The Scheme code is written using the ``eopl`` dialect provided by DrRacket 6.4. Please refer to `the official DrRacket documentation`__ for more details. Most code snippets are tested using ``rackunit``.

To run the code, first install Racket 6.4+, then install the ``eopl`` package::

    $ raco pkg install eopl

After installing the ``eopl`` package, running the scheme code should be as easy as::

    $ racket <file-path>
